        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 10, 2025</p>

        <p>Abma Tech built the FaceScore Pro app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Abma Tech at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

        <p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>

        <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at FaceScore Pro unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, specifically the images you choose to upload for analysis. The information that we request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.</p>

        <p>The core functionality of FaceScore Pro involves analyzing facial features from images you upload. When you upload an image:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The image is securely transmitted to a third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) service provider specifically Grok AI for processing.</li>
            <li>The AI service analyzes the facial features within the image.</li>
            <li>The resulting analysis (face score/analysis data) is returned to the app and displayed to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Image Data Handling:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>We require your explicit action to upload an image.</li>
            <li>Uploaded images are used *solely* for the purpose of providing the face analysis feature through our AI partner.</li>
            <li>We do not store your uploaded images on our servers after the analysis is complete and the results have been returned to the app. The processing is intended to be ephemeral on our side.</li>
            <li>The analysis results generated from the image are displayed within the app for your viewing and are not persistently stored on our servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The app may also use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you (e.g., for analytics or crash reporting). Links to the privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app (if any) would be listed here.</p>
        <!-- Example:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        </ul>
         -->

        <h2>Log Data</h2>

        <p>We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in case of an error in the app we may collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics. This data is used for debugging and improving service reliability.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>

        <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.</p>

        <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.</p>

        <h2>Service Providers</h2>

        <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service (e.g., the AI provider);</li>
            <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
            <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to certain Personal Information (specifically the images you upload, in the case of our AI provider). The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. As mentioned, the primary third party is our AI service provider for face analysis.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it (e.g., using secure transmission protocols like HTTPS when sending images to the API). But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

        <p>This Service may contain links to other sites (e.g., the AI provider's privacy policy). If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

        <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers (to the extent we have access or control, primarily concerning any log data). If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

        <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
         <p>Since we do not store your uploaded images or the analysis results on our servers long-term, there is no persistent user account data stored by Abma Tech to access or delete directly via the app. If you have any concerns about data handling or wish to inquire about any potential residual data (like logs), please contact us using the information below. Users can control their data primarily by choosing which images to upload or by uninstalling the application.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
        <p>This policy is effective as of the date stated at the top.</p>
